Hello World
<br>

To get started working with a repository, you will first need to clone it. Cloning copies a repository to your local machine.
<br>
Navigate to the repository you want to clone. Click on the green button titled "code" and copy the SSH link. From the command line, you will navigate to the
directory where you want the repository to exist. For the dataWizardry repository, run this line: `git clone git@github.com:CAPR-Consortium/dataWizardry.git`.


`git pull`          Before editing any script, pull the latest changes from the repository.

After saving your edits, you will push changes to the repository.

`git add *`         Prepares content (your local edits) staged for the next commit.

`git commit -m "message about changes you made"`          Commits the staged snapshot with a message

`git push`          Uploads your local changes.


Other useful commands:

`git status`          Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area.

`git log`         Displays commit history.
